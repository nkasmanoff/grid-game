# Grid Game

This is a simple work-in-progress implementation of the popular grid games like hoopgrids and immaculate grid in react. I'm slowly building it up and still thinking about what data to actually
run this with, but this is a semi functional implementation only a few steps away from working. Will update the readme as I make changes.

To run this locally, in the the project directory, enter in your terminal

### `npm install`

and then 

### `npm start`
